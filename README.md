# Predicting_Critical_Temp_Superconductors
Code for EEPS 1960D final project. 
The data exploration and baseline approach is in the base_line.ipynb file, the secondary approach is in RandomForest.ipynb, and the final approach is in joint.ipynb. elements.ipynb contains a mini fit using only the element data, which is not included in the report.
